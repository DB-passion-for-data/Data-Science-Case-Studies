## Problem Statement
Ross, the marketing director of an artificial intelligence (AI) conference, had to report to the board with recommendations for short tail keywords for the marketing of the 2015 conference. He also had to come up with a visualization of research papers submitted so far, grouped by their paper type. The conference is run by a nonprofit scientific society that ensures advancements in the domains of artificial intelligence. It does so by enhancing public understanding of the domain, as well as by providing researchers with a platform for them to present their findings in yearly conferences. In order to come up with a solution for the problem at hand, Ross started off by going through the web site. However, the magnitude of content from the research papers was too much for him to make an analysis.

Ross loaded the data dump in Microsoft Excel and started looking through the features. He thought that one strategy could be to group the papers by keywords or groups. He could then run separate ads on social media and use SEO (search engine optimization) to target the respective keywords within them. However, there were too many distinct values within keywords and group features, and thus they would result in many clusters of SEO keywords. His strategy was to come up with a maximum of ten different SEO keyword groups and let them run for several days to reap benefits. He had heard something about clustering, where you cluster the data into a fixed number of clusters, and so he decided that clustering would be his starting point.
