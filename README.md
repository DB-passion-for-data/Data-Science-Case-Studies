Data Science is extensively used in the business related areas to improve their services , products and therefore, Revenue.
There are variety of problems that can be solved using data science. Here , in this repo, I have tried to solve some problems :

#### 1. Building a Brand Persona for Cycle Sharing Services
I have tried to analyse the cycle sharing data and found out the type of customers to target and time & place to 
place ads and implement marketing strategies.

#### 2. Removing Inconsistencies in Concrete Compressive strenghts.
I used regression analysis and found out the variables that contribute most towards determination of concrete strengths.
It can help the testing unit to determine certain thresholds and important factors related to concrete strength, thus improving the quality of concrete.
