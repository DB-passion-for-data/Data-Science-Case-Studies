## Problem Statement:
I am  assigned with the huge task of determining the brand persona
for a new cycle share scheme. We had to present our results at this year’s annual
board meeting in order to lay out a strong marketing plan for reaching out to
potential customers.

The cycle sharing scheme provides means for the people of the city to commute
using a convenient, cheap, and green transportation alternative. The service has 500
bikes at 50 stations across Seattle. Each of the stations has a dock locking system (where
all bikes are parked); kiosks (so customers can get a membership key or pay for a trip);
and a helmet rental service. A person can choose between purchasing a membership
key or short-term pass. A membership key entitles an annual membership, and the key
can be obtained from a kiosk. Advantages for members include quick retrieval of bikes
and unlimited 45-minute rentals. Short-term passes offer access to bikes for a 24-hour
or 3-day time interval. Riders can avail and return the bikes at any of the 50 stations
citywide.

Jason started this service in May 2014 and since then had been focusing on
increasing the number of bikes as well as docking stations in order to increase
convenience and accessibility for his customers. Despite this expansion, customer
retention remained an issue. As Jason recalled, “We had planned to put in the investment
for a year to lay out the infrastructure necessary for the customers to start using it. We
had a strategy to make sure that the retention levels remain high to make this model self-
sustainable. However, it worked otherwise (i.e., the customer base didn’t catch up with
the rate of the infrastructure expansion).”

A private service would have had three alternatives to curb this problem: get
sponsors on board, increase service charges, or expand the pool of customers. Price hikes
were not an option for Jason as this was a publicly sponsored initiative with the goal of
providing affordable transportation to all. As for increasing the customer base, they had
to decide upon a marketing channel that guarantees broad reach on low cost incurred.

I realized that attracting recurring customers on a minimal budget
required understanding the customers in the first place (i.e., persona). As stated,
“Understanding the persona of your brand is essential, as it helps you reach a targeted
audience which is likely to convert at a higher probability. Moreover, this also helps in
reaching out to sponsors who target a similar persona. This two-fold approach can make
our bottom line positive.”

## Some key Visualizations
### 1. Trip duration

- We can see some seasonailty here as well. The distribution is dense in lower values and spikes can be seen frequently.
- We see that at the start of business in 2014 , there are many huge spikes, so people were using cycle sharing service more during its early time.
- We can see that trip made at start of the year and at end of year are generally of less duration .
-  Trip Duration increases after April and this trend is seen till July. So this Duration can be seen as an Opportunity to increase our marketing campaign.

### 2. Customers and their Birth Year

Here we see that really male dominated here too most of the times. But at certain years like those who were born between 1946 - 1952,1964 and 1994, female dominated over males. Moreover subscribers born in 1947 were all females.

It can also be seen that members who were born in 1957 were mostly belonged to 'Others' gender category. A significant portion of members from this category was also seen from the birthyear 1987.

### 3 .Distribution of number of trips by Year

We see that most of the trips are taken in 2015. It was very less when the cycle sharing service was started in May 2014 , and suddenly got a huge boost in 2015. But the company started loosing customers after 2015.

## Conclusion
I analysed the data and thus reached to final thoughts:
- The Data was only given for Members, so we seperately have to analyse by gathering more data about Short-term pass Holders.
- Our Main marketing Area should be **Pier 69/Alaskan Way & clay St station** as it is the station from which maximum trips are originated.
- Our Marketing Banner should focus more upon the **age-group 34-40**.
- Since mostly males were the prime members of this service, We should also focus upon increasing our reach to females , thus also making a diligent part of our campaign. 
- The prime time when long trips were usually made were during April to July. According to <a href ='https://travel.usnews.com/Seattle_WA/When_To_Visit'>Best Time to visit Seattle</a> these are the months when Seattle mostly experience tourists and customers. So by giving special offers and discounts we can attract more customers for using this service.
