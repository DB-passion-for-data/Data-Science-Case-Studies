# Exploring trend in names

## Changing naming practices
A development related to the rate acceleration in name changes is name diver- sification. It has been observed by various scholars that over the course of the past two centuries more and more names came into use, while at the same time, the most popular names were given to less and less children (Lieberson 2000). In this section, we attempt to back up these two claims with some empirical evidence.

The first claim can be addressed by investigating the type-token ratio of names as it progresses through time. The annual type-token ratio is computed by dividing the number of unique names occurring in a particular year (i.e., the type frequency) by the sum of their frequencies (i.e., the token frequency). For each year, our data set provides the frequency of occurrence of all unique names occurring at least five times in that year. Computing the type-token ratio, then, can be accomplished by dividing the number of rows by the sum of the names’ frequencies.

The results show a clear decline in the usage frequency of the most popular names over time.

At first glance, the visualization above seems to run counter to the hypothesis of name diversification. After all, the type-ratio remains relatively high until the early 1900s, and it is approximately equal to modern times. Were people as creative name givers in the beginning of the twentieth century as they are today? No, they were not. To understand the relatively high ratio in the beginning of the twentieth century, it should be taken into account that the dataset misses many records from before 1935, when the Social Security Number system was introduced in the United States. Thus, the peaks in type-token ratio at the beginning of the twentieth century essentially represent an artifact of the data. After 1935, the data are more complete and more reliable. Starting in the 1960s, we can observe a steady increase of the type-token ratio, which is more in line with the hypothesis of increasing diversity.

## A bias for names ending in n?

It has been noted at various occasions that one of the most striking changes in the practice of name giving is the explosive rise in the popularity of boy names ending with the letter n.

#### Boy name-final letter frequencies over time

The time series visualization of the usage frequency of the name-final letter n confirms the suggested explosive rise in the popularity of boys’ names ending with the letter n. Over the years, the numbers gradually increase before they suddenly take off in the 1990s and 2000s. A second observation to be made is the steady decrease of the name-final letter e as well as the letter d. Finally, we note a relatively sudden disposition for the letter i in the late 1990s.

## Unisex names in the United States¶

The unisex degree of a name can be defined in terms of its usage ratio between boys and girls. A name with a 50-50 split appears to be more unisex than a name with a 5- 95 split. Furthermore, names that retain a 50-50 split over the years are more ambiguous as to whether they refer to boys or girls than names with strong fluctuations in their usage rati
